								<p class="cc cc-1">The story of slate begins about 470 million years ago, a time in Earth's history when Pennsylvania and the continent of North America were located near the equator. Great marine reefs located in shallow seas along the continent's eastern edge had been growing for millions of years.</p>
								<p class="cc cc-2">Now they were threatened by a large arc of offshore volcanic islands that were slowly being pushed westward by tectonic forces generated deep below the Earthâ€™s surface. The islands were on a collision course with the reefs and the North American continent.</p>
							</div>
							<!-- Step 2 -->
							<div class="step-2">
								<img src="_images/p1_s2.png" alt="_images/p1_s2.png">
								<p class="cc cc-3">Moving land masses, called tectonic plates, move very, very slowly. The tectonic plate you live on is moving right now, but the movement is so slow that you will never detect it in your lifetime. The collision between North America and the volcanic arc of islands lasted 20 million years. The "shoving match" caused the volcanic islands to be pushed upward into a tall mountain chain; the edge of North America crumpled into a deep marine basin covered by seawater.</p>
							</div>
							<!-- Step 3 -->
							<div class="step-3">
								<img src="_images/p1_s3.png" alt="_images/p1_s3.png">
								<p class="cc cc-4">Rainwater eroded the hard mountain rock into smaller rocks of all sizes called sediments. Sand, silt, and clay are three of the smallest sediments. Sometimes the silt and clay mixed with fine soil particles to make a "mud." Rivers that formed during this time carried the sediments and mud into the sea and deposited them on the bottom of the marine basin.</p>

								<p class="cc cc-1">Sea currents also carried the sediments and deposited them far offshore in deeper water. Over time the sediments formed a continental shelf up and down the length of the continent. The side of the shelf that sloped steeply toward the deep ocean was called the continental slope. The area where the steep slope bottomed out and met the ocean floor was called the continental rise.<p>
								<p class="cc cc-2">Sediments on the slope often accumulated and grew to great heights; portions of them sometimes broke away and slid down the slope, causing an avalanche. Sediments carried by the avalanches dug into the slope and rise and created submarine canyons and submarine fans of sediment. Over time these sediments accumulated into thick layers on the ocean floor.</p>

								<img src="_images/p3_s1.png" alt="_images/p3_s1.png">
								<p class="cc cc-1">The deep water of the continental shelf provided a dark and cold environment.  Animals that lived there were bottom dwellers and fed mostly on food particles that floated down from the ocean surface. This undersea environment was dominated by creatures called brachiopods, trilobites, and crinoids.</p>
							</div>
							<!-- Step 2 -->
							<div class="step-2">
								<img src="_images/p3_s2.png" alt="_images/p3_s2.png">
								<p class="cc cc-2">As the sediments collected into thick layers, the weight of the top layers squeezed - or compressed - the bottom layers into sedimentary rocks called mudstone and shale. Many of the sea creatures that lived on the continental shelf drifted down the slope when they died and became buried in the sediments.  Some eventually became fossils when the sediments surrounding them hardened into rock.</p>
							</div>
							<!-- Step 3 -->
							<div class="step-3">
								<img src="_images/p3_s3.png" alt="_images/p3_s3.png">
								<p class="cc cc-3">Some fossils in the mudstone and shale are made from tiny animals called graptolites, which lived together in colonies that floated on the ocean surface. Colonies of graptolites are one form of plankton.	When graptolites died, they sank to the ocean bottom, became buried in the mud and clay, and fossilized as time passed.</p>
							</div>
							<!-- Step 3.5 -->
							<div class="step-3-5">
								<img src="Coal/_images/p4_s1.png" alt="../Coal/_images/p4_s1.png">
								<p class="cc cc-4">Over the next 200 million years, two major continental collisions occurred between North America and Africa that folded the layers of the deeply submerged shale. The second collision of the continents created the Appalachian Mountains some 280 million years ago.</p>
							</div>
							<!-- Step 4 -->
							<div class="step-4">
								<img src="_images/p3_s4.png" alt="_images/p3_s4.png">
								<p class="cc cc-5">As the continental collisions occurred, some layers of shale were compressed, folded, and heated enough to be changed into a metamorphic rock called slate.</p>
							</div>
							<!-- Step 5 -->
							<div class="step-5">
								<img src="_images/p3_s5.png" alt="_images/p3_s5.png">
								<p class="cc cc-6">The heat and pressure created during the folding process rearranged the clay particles in the shale. This rearrangement caused layering, or foliation, in the slate. Because it is foliated, slate can be split into hard, thin, water tight sheets that are used as roof "shingles" and floor tiles, and many other building materials.</p>

Large blocks or sections of the lithosphere, called tectonic plates, are moved horizontally in different directions over time by the asthenosphere, a layer of flowing molten rock below the lithosphere.

Among the most successful of all early animals, Trilobites were mostly bottom-dwelling predators, scavengers, and filter-feeders that lived in the oceans from about 520 million years ago to their extinction 250 million years ago.</p></li>
