						<p class="cc cc-1">Coal's ability to burn has made it one of the most important rocks on Earth. It has lighted fires and provided heat and energy to homes and industries around the world for a thousand years.</p>
						<p class="cc cc-2">Eastern Pennsylvania's Carbon and Luzerne counties are blessed with an underground abundance of anthracite coal, whose high carbon content allows it to burn hotter and longer than other varieties.</p>
						<p class="cc cc-3">Coal was mined in the region in the early 1800s and replaced charcoal as the fuel that stoked the great blast furnaces at iron towns in Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton and Bucks counties.</p>
						<p class="cc cc-4">The abundance of coal and iron and the availability of a cheap immigrant labor force helped the region become an industrial leader and an important player in the birth and growth of the American Industrial Revolution.</p>

								<img src="_images/p3_s1.png" alt="_images/p3_s1.png">
								<p class="cc cc-1">Tremendous heat and pressure are required to change peat into coal. The heat and pressure in the coal-making process came from the weight of sediments &dash; such as sand and mud &dash; that accumulated on top of the peat layers that laid at the bottom of the swamps.</p>
								<p class="cc cc-2">Sometimes the sand and mud was carried into the swamps by rivers. At other times, rising sea levels carried sand into the swamps. As the swamps became covered with sediments over millions of years, the weight and pressure of the sediments heated and compressed the buried peat layers, squeezing out water and gases from the partly decayed plant material and changing the peat into a type of coal called lignite.</p>

								<img class="coal4" src="_images/p3_s2_coal4.png" alt="_images/p3_s2_coal1.png">
								<p class="cc cc-3">As compression forced out water and gases in the peat, it concentrated carbon atoms that were used during photosynthesis, a process by which plants make leaves and wood. Materials that contain large amounts of carbon have energy and are combustible, meaning they are able to burn. Wood, for example, is about 50% carbon; peat about 60%. Although coal is a rock, its high levels of carbon allow it to burn.</p>
								<p class="cc cc-4">Coal receives a grade, or rank, by how much carbon it contains. Lignite, with up to 70% carbon, is a low rank coal. Fifty feet of peat compresses into approximately 10 feet of lignite. Compressing lignite further increases the carbon concentration and produces a higher rank coal called bituminous coal, which has a carbon concentration of 75 to 85%. Ten feet of lignite compresses into approximately five feet of bituminous coal.</p>

										<li><p><a href="javascript:void(0);">Peat:</a> A deposit of partially decayed dead plant material in a water-filled environment (wetland swamps and bogs).  Peat deposits are the earliest stage in the formation of coal. Peat is about 60% carbon.</p></li>

The atoms of carbon can link with one another into rings and chains to form molecules like those in coal, that when burned, release large amounts of energy.</p></li>
										<li><p><a href="javascript:void(0);">Photosynthesis:</a> The process by which plant cells make high-energy carbon compounds (like sugar) by combining carbon dioxide and water using sunlight energy, and releasing oxygen. It is the energy in the carbon compounds made by ancient plants using photosynthesis that is released as heat energy when coal is burned.</p></li>
										<li><p><a href="javascript:void(0);">Combustion:</a> Chemical reactions during the burning of a fuel (like coal) in the presence of oxygen that release heat and light energy.</p></li>
										<li><p><a href="javascript:void(0);">Rank:</a> The rank of coal is generally based on its carbon content. Lignite (up to 70% carbon) is a low rank coal. Bituminous coal (75 to 85% carbon) is higher in rank. Anthracite (up to 98% carbon) is the highest ranked and cleanest burning coal.</p></li>

										<li><p><a href="javascript:void(0);">Anthracite coal:</a> A hard, black, shiny coal formed from bituminous coal. Anthracite has the highest amount of carbon (up to 98%) of the 3 general types of coal and the fewest impurities, and so is the cleanest burning coal.</p></li>
										<li><p><a href="javascript:void(0);">Plate tectonics theory:</a> Plate tectonics is a scientific theory that describes the large scale movements of the Earth's crust over time. The Earth’s crust is broken into sections or tectonic plates that ride on and are moved by flowing, liquid-like rock in a layer below the crust called the asthenosphere. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur where the plates meet along tectonic plate boundaries.</p></li>

										<li><p><a href="javascript:void(0);">Electricity:</a> Energy generated by the presence and flow of charged particles. A flow or movement of electrically charged particles can generate energy over time or electrical power.  Coal is burned to produce the heat to boil water into steam that drives the turbines used in generating the electrical power used to run air conditioners, refrigerators, heaters, computers, light bulbs, toys, and cars.</p></li>
